Question
========================================================
 1. Why does it take four scattering events to produce a caustic? Give a diagram
      or otherwise explain what those events are.

It takes four scattering events to produce a caustic, since... something to do with hemispheres?

 2. Derive an asymptotic bound on the run time of the global illumination renderer from the
      Rays project, were it to recurse to an arbitrary path depth. Recall that it traced one
      primary ray per pixel, computed direct illumination from all sources, and then spawned
      $r$ recursive rays. Use the variables: $n$ pixels, $d$ maximum path depth, $p$ primary
      rays per pixel, $L$ lights in the scene. It may help to draw a tree of the recursive
      calls.

$O(n*d*p*L). (Will actually have powers, because recursion.)$

 3. Derive an asymptotic bound on the run time of the path tracer from this project using the
      same variables from the previous question.

$O(n*d*p*L)$

 4. Derive an algorithm to sample the numbers from 0 to 100 proportional to their value.
      For example, write a random integer generator in which zero will never be returned,
      two will be returned twice as often as one, 100 will be returned twice as frequently
      as 50, and so on. Assume that you already have a uniform random number generator on
      the interval [0, 100].

To sample the numbers from 0 to 100...

5. In your own words (and with equations and diagrams as needed), present an mathematically
      rigorous argument that path tracing as presented in this project converges to a true
      solution to the rendering equation as the path length and number of paths per pixel
      approach infinity. State any assumptions underlying that argument explicitly.
