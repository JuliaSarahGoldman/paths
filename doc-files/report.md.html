Design
======================================================
We have a [PathTracer](class_path_tracer.html) class, which keeps a TriTree of all the triangles in the scene as state, as well as all the specifications passed in through the GUI. To trace an image, the user calls [traceImage](class_path_tracer.html#a1d3cbafc273194884120aa2fba75caef), providing a camera and an image. Trace image has two main for loops, one within the other. The outer loops in the number of paths. It will [generatePrimaryRays](class_path_tracer.html#afa6371b7272e15b0f213136eed8c0ff0) in a buffer for each one, and sets the modulation buffer to 1/(the number of rays). Then within the for loop, we loop in the number of scattering events. We fill our surfel buffer with the surfel hit by the primary ray of each pixel. Then, we [computeShadowRays](class_path_tracer.html#a7f85f1758c849eabf4e4eb5badefaea3) for each pixel in parallel. In doing so, we choose a light by sampling, and then cast a ray from the light to the surfel, and store light's biradiance, weighed by the probability of choosing it, in our biradiance buffer. Then, we fill our shadowRayBuffer by attempting to intersect our shadow rays with closer surfels, determining whether or not a shadow in cast. Having determined that, we [writeToImage](class_path_tracer.html#a43a8e2c0afaf50e26b666c91fa8ea113) in parallel. In doing that, we add to each pixel's current color the biradiance for it in the biradiance buffer multiplied by its surfel's finite scattering density and the dot product of the surfel's normal vector with the incoming ray's vector. Then, we in parallel [generateRecursiveRays](class_path_tracer.html#af6213ec93fd8a1639569b31cf1f1f1f8), using the surfel's scatter function to determine the angle we cast our new ray in for each pixel, and we update the modulation buffer to lessen the impact of the recursive rays.

Question
========================================================
 1. Why does it take four scattering events to produce a caustic? Give a diagram
      or otherwise explain what those events are.
        
    It takes 4 scattered rays to produce a caustic: 1 to intersect one surfel coming into the sphere, 1 to intersect the surfel coming out of the sphere, 1 to hit the surfel outside of the sohere, and 1 to hit the "eye."    

 2. Derive an asymptotic bound on the run time of the global illumination renderer from the
      Rays project, were it to recurse to an arbitrary path depth. Recall that it traced one
      primary ray per pixel, computed direct illumination from all sources, and then spawned
      $r$ recursive rays. Use the variables: $n$ pixels, $d$ maximum path depth, $p$ primary
      rays per pixel, $L$ lights in the scene. It may help to draw a tree of the recursive
      calls.
        
        Since ray tracing casts $p=1$ primary ray per pixel, each iterating through all lights, and then generating $r$ recursive rays in each level of recursion, we have time complexity
        $$O(n*L*r^d)$$

 3. Derive an asymptotic bound on the run time of the path tracer from this project using the
      same variables from the previous question.
       
        Path tracing casts $p$ rays per $n$ pixels and for $d$ iterations each $p*n$ rays iterate through the lights once to sample, being updated at the end to one recursive ray $r=1$ and moving on to the next $d$ iteration. We then have time complexity: 
        $$O(n*d*p*L)$$

 4. Derive an algorithm to sample the numbers from 0 to 100 proportional to their value.
      For example, write a random integer generator in which zero will never be returned,
      two will be returned twice as often as one, 100 will be returned twice as frequently
      as 50, and so on. Assume that you already have a uniform random number generator on
      the interval [0, 100].

        First we need to initialize a counter to a uniform random number between 0 and the sum of all the numbers between 0 and 100. This can be selected using the uniform random number generator from 0 to 100. To do this, we select a random number between 0 and 100, x. Then, we select x distinct (if a number is repeated, we throw it away) numbers between 0 and 100 and sum them to get our random counter. Then, we begin subtracting the numbers from 0 to 100 from the counter, until the counter crosses over from positive to negative. Whichever number's subtraction caused the counter to go negative is the one that is chosen.

5. In your own words (and with equations and diagrams as needed), present an mathematically
      rigorous argument that path tracing as presented in this project converges to a true
      solution to the rendering equation as the path length and number of paths per pixel
      approach infinity. State any assumptions underlying that argument explicitly.
