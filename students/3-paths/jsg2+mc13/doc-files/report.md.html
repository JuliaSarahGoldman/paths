Design
======================================================
We have a [PathTracer](class_path_tracer.html) class, which keeps a TriTree of all the triangles in the scene as state, as well as all the specifications passed in through the GUI. To trace an image, the user calls [traceImage](class_path_tracer.html#a1d3cbafc273194884120aa2fba75caef), providing a camera and an image. Trace image has two main for loops, one within the other. The outer loops in the number of paths. It will [generatePrimaryRays](class_path_tracer.html#afa6371b7272e15b0f213136eed8c0ff0) in a buffer for each one, and sets the modulation buffer to 1/(the number of rays). Then within the for loop, we loop in the number of scattering events. We fill our surfel buffer with the surfel hit by the primary ray of each pixel. Then, we [computeShadowRays](class_path_tracer.html#a7f85f1758c849eabf4e4eb5badefaea3) for each pixel in parallel. In doing so, we choose a light by sampling, and then cast a ray from the light to the surfel, and store light's biradiance, weighed by the probability of choosing it, in our biradiance buffer. Then, we fill our shadowRayBuffer by attempting to intersect our shadow rays with closer surfels, determining whether or not a shadow in cast. Having determined that, we [writeToImage](class_path_tracer.html#a43a8e2c0afaf50e26b666c91fa8ea113) in parallel. In doing that, we add to each pixel's current color the biradiance for it in the biradiance buffer multiplied by its surfel's finite scattering density and the dot product of the surfel's normal vector with the incoming ray's vector. Then, we in parallel [generateRecursiveRays](class_path_tracer.html#af6213ec93fd8a1639569b31cf1f1f1f8), using the surfel's scatter function to determine the angle we cast our new ray in for each pixel, and we update the modulation buffer to lessen the impact of the recursive rays.

Questions
========================================================
 1. It takes 4 scattered rays to produce a caustic: 1 to intersect one surfel coming into the sphere, 1 to intersect the surfel coming out of the sphere, 1 to hit the surfel outside of the sohere, and 1 to hit the "eye."    

 2. Since ray tracing casts $p=1$ primary ray per pixel, each iterating through all lights, and then generating $r$ recursive rays in each level of recursion, we have time complexity
        $$O(n*L*r^d)$$

 3. Path tracing casts $p$ rays per $n$ pixels and for $d$ iterations each $p*n$ rays iterate through the lights once to sample, being updated at the end to one recursive ray $r=1$ and moving on to the next $d$ iteration. We then have time complexity: 
        $$O(n*d*p*L)$$

 4. First we need to initialize a counter to a uniform random number between 0 and the sum of all the numbers between 0 and 100. This can be selected using the uniform random number generator from 0 to 100. To do this, we select a random number between 0 and 100, x. Then, we select x distinct (if a number is repeated, we throw it away) numbers between 0 and 100 and sum them to get our random counter. Then, we begin subtracting the numbers from 0 to 100 from the counter, until the counter crosses over from positive to negative. Whichever number's subtraction caused the counter to go negative is the one that is chosen.

5.  As the path length approaches infinity, we account for all the light in the scene, which solves for infinite scattering density $f_{X,\n}(\wi,\wo)$.
    As the number of paths per pixel approaches infinity, we obtain infinite continuous sampling of shading at every pixel, which essentially solves the  integral in the rendering equation    
           $$\int_{\mathbf{S}^2_+} L(X + \epsilon\wi, -\wi) \cdot f_{X,\n}(\wi,\wo) \cdot |\wi \cdot \n| ~ d\wi$$   



Self Review
========================================================
- Grade: B+/A-
- Code Design: Our design is reasonable. Our code is divided into logical helper functions.
- Code Readability: Our code looks like it is doing what it does, although with so many variables getting passed around, one could get lost.
- Expected Code Correctness: Our code seems correct, aside from some weirdness in our light sampling.
- Report Quality: Our report contains everything it should.
- Report Correctness: Our report is as correct as we can get it.
- Workflow: We spent too long planning out our functions and reorganizing our header file before beginning implementation. We should have started generating images to debug earlier.
