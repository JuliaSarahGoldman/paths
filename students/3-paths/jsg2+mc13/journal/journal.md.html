2016-10-02: A spot of color!
=============================================================
We are not getting any surfels whatsoever. Also, no sky. Odd. We must be generating primary rays improperly, since we're using the built in intersect. Very, very odd.

Arrived 3 pm.

2016-10-01: More organization needed
====================================================================

6:00 We have code for all our major functions. Lights are currently chosen randomly, and we have loops instead of multithreading.

Currently 5:35 pm. Implementing functions in parallel. Have realized we should not worry about light sampling right away. Currently have implementations for generatePrimaryRays, writeToImage, and generateRecursiveRays. In the process of implementing testVisibility. Then, we'll move to actually calculating the shadow rays.

Arrived 2 pm. Struggle to relate pseudo code from lab with python code from lecture notes. Began writing traceImage to determine whetehr we actually had the helper functions we needed with the correct parameters and return values. Determined from this that we had not organized our helper functions properly, and attempted to reorganize. It is now 3:35 pm.

2016-09-29: Scheduled Lab Period
====================================================================
Created GUI.
Combined code from both of our RayTracer classes to get starter code we were happy with. Fiddled with header.

2016-09-28: Draft Design
====================================================================
[6:52 pm, 7:55pm]
Path tracers converge to the solution of: 
\begin{equation}
\Lo(X, \wo) = \Le(X, \wo) + \int_{\mathbf{S}^2} \Li(X, \wi) \cdot f_x(\wi, \wo) \cdot |\wi \cdot \n| ~ d\wi.
\end{equation}
